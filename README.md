Adversarial Machine Learning Project
Overview

This project explores Adversarial Machine Learning (AML), which studies how intentionally crafted inputs, known as adversarial examples, can deceive AI and machine learning models. These inputs appear normal to humans but cause models to misclassify or behave incorrectly. Adversarial attacks pose risks to critical applications, including autonomous vehicles, finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.

Features

Study of attack types:

Poisoning Attacks (training-time attacks)

Evasion Attacks (inference-time attacks)

Model Extraction & Inference Attacks

Transfer Attacks

Analysis of threat models:

White-box, Black-box, and Gray-box attacks

Real-world examples of AML attacks:

Tesla Autopilot, Microsoft Tay, Credit Card Fraud, Facial Recognition evasion

Defense strategies:

Adversarial training

Defensive distillation

Input preprocessing (denoising, resizing, feature squeezing)

Robust model architecture & certified defenses

Enterprise-level ML security practices

Objectives

Understand vulnerabilities in ML models
