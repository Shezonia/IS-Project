# 🔐 Adversarial Machine Learning Toolkit

> 🧠 **Exploring how adversarial attacks exploit vulnerabilities in AI systems — and how we can defend against them.**

---

## 📌 Overview

**Adversarial Machine Learning (AML)** explores how tiny, often invisible perturbations in inputs can trick ML models into making wrong predictions. These attacks are especially dangerous in sensitive domains like:

- 🚗 Autonomous Vehicles  
- 💳 Financial Fraud Systems  
- 🏥 Healthcare Diagnostics  
- 🛡️ Cybersecurity  

This project dives deep into how adversarial attacks work, real-world examples, and defense strategies to make ML models resilient.
